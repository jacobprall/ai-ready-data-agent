description: Optimize data for retrieval-augmented generation

stages:
  - name: Data Quality
    why: "Dirty data means empty chunks and garbage retrieval results"
    requirements:
      data_completeness: { max: 0.01 }
      uniqueness: { max: 0.01 }

  - name: Schema Understanding
    why: "Semantic models enable Text-to-SQL and help the LLM understand your data"
    requirements:
      semantic_documentation: { min: 1.00 }

  - name: Retrieval Performance
    why: "Optimized access keeps retrieval latency low at scale"
    requirements:
      access_optimization: { min: 0.80 }
      search_optimization: { min: 0.80 }

  - name: Change Management
    why: "Enables incremental re-indexing instead of full rebuilds on every refresh"
    requirements:
      change_detection: { min: 1.00 }
      data_freshness: { min: 1.00 }

  - name: Data Governance
    why: "Prevents PII from leaking into RAG responses"
    requirements:
      classification: { min: 0.50 }
      field_masking: { min: 1.00 }
